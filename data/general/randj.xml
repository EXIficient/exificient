                              <line>Than those that have more cunning to be strange.</line>
                              <line>I should have been more strange, I must confess,</line>

                              <line>On Thursday next be married to this County.</line>

                              <line>I dreamt my lady came and found me dead</line>

                              <line>Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves</line>

                              <line>Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;</line>
                              <line>And she, there dead, that Romeo&apos;s faithful wife.</line>
                              <line>I married them; and their stol&apos;n marriage day</line>
                              <line>Was Tybalt&apos;s doomsday, whose untimely death</line>
                              <line>Banish&apos;d the new-made bridegroom from this city;</line>
                              <line>For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pin&apos;d.</line>
                              <line>You, to remove that siege of grief from her, </line>
                              <line>Betroth&apos;d and would have married her perforce</line>
                              <line>To County Paris. Then comes she to me</line>
                              <line>And with wild looks bid me devise some mean</line>
                              <line>To rid her from this second marriage,</line>
                              <line>Or in my cell there would she kill herself.</line>
                              <line>Then gave I her (so tutored by my art)</line>
                              <line>A sleeping potion; which so took effect</line>
                              <line>As I intended, for it wrought on her</line>
                              <line>The form of death. Meantime I writ to Romeo</line>
                              <line>That he should hither come as this dire night</line>
                              <line>To help to take her from her borrowed grave,</line>
                              <line>Being the time the potion&apos;s force should cease.</line>
                              <line>But he which bore my letter, Friar John,</line>
                              <line>Was stay&apos;d by accident, and yesternight</line>
                              <line>Return&apos;d my letter back. Then all alone</line>
                              <line>At the prefixed hour of her waking</line>
                              <line>Came I to take her from her kindred&apos;s vault;</line>
                              <line>Meaning to keep her closely at my cell</line>
                              <line>Till I conveniently could send to Romeo.</line>
                              <line>But when I came, some minute ere the time </line>
                              <line>Of her awaking, here untimely lay</line>
                              <line>The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.</line>
                              <line>She wakes; and I entreated her come forth</line>
                              <line>And bear this work of heaven with patience;</line>
                              <line>But then a noise did scare me from the tomb,</line>
                              <line>And she, too desperate, would not go with me,</line>
                              <line>But, as it seems, did violence on herself.</line>
