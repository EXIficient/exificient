EXI Grammars.

<p>EXI is a knowledge based encoding that uses a set of grammars to
determine which events are most likely to occur at any given point in an
EXI stream and encodes the most likely alternatives in fewer bits. It
does this by mapping the stream of events to a lower entropy set of
representative values and encoding those values using a set of simple
variable length codes or an EXI compression algorithm.</p>
